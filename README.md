# üöó YOLOv8 Object Detection on Self-Driving Cars Dataset

This project focuses on **Object Detection** using **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8)** applied to the **Self-Driving Cars Dataset**.  
The aim is to accurately detect vehicles, pedestrians, and other driving-related objects from images ‚Äî simulating the perception systems used in autonomous driving.

Implemented in **Google Colab**, this experiment demonstrates the complete workflow: data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of detection results.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to train a YOLOv8 model capable of detecting various objects typically seen in driving scenarios.  
The **Self-Driving Cars Dataset** contains labeled images captured from a car‚Äôs perspective, making it ideal for experimenting with real-world object detection in traffic environments.

### üîç Steps Performed
1. **Environment Setup** ‚Äì Installed required libraries and configured YOLOv8.  
2. **Dataset Integration** ‚Äì Loaded and prepared the Self-Driving Cars dataset.  
3. **Training Phase** ‚Äì Trained YOLOv8 on the dataset with custom parameters.  
4. **Validation & Testing** ‚Äì Evaluated model performance on unseen samples.  
5. **Inference & Visualization** ‚Äì Generated predictions with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
